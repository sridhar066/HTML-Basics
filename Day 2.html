      <p>One of the best things about this place is that it can be visited at any time of the year. All you’ve got to do is pick a date and pack your bags. However, if you’re looking for the ideal weather, then plan your trip between October to May, since the temperature during this time ranges from 10 to 40 degrees Celsius. The remaining months, which are June to September often receive moderate rainfall, which keep the hills drenched throughout the time. Therefore, whenever you are planning to pack your bag for an exciting trip you can consider the places to visit in South India and if you are fond of travelling to hill stations then there is no other choices than choosing Nandi hills. Besides that, Nandi Hills weather can be enjoyed throughout the year.</p>
